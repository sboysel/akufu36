# akufu36 build guide

From the [Thingiverse v2 listing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4593582):

    This keyboard was designed for my small hands.

    The switch plate can be mounted with gaskets.

    Please provide 6 mm long M3 screws and insert nuts(length: 5mm). The screws should be low head screws.

    The recess for the rubber feet is 7.9 mm in diameter.

    To make a gasket mount, I stuck two EVA sheets with a thickness of 1.5mm to the screw holes on the switch plate.

    For easier maintenance, I recommend attaching masking tape to the back of the Pro Micro to create tabs.

    I use a stainless steel tip that I had on hand as a 35g weight.

    If you want to add indentations for the weights, or change the size of the screws and insert nuts, you can edit the step format file in 3D CAD.

    The holes in the switch plate are 14.2mm x 14.2mm to match the characteristics of my 3D printer. It may be too big or too small depending on the material of the filament and the characteristics of the printer.

    If you need to make corrections, please edit the STEP data.
